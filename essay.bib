 abstract = {<p>Political scientists have long classified systems of government
as parliamentary or presidential, two-party or multiparty, and so
on. But such distinctions often fail to provide useful insights.
For example, how are we to compare the United States, a
presidential bicameral regime with two weak parties, to Denmark, a
parliamentary unicameral regime with many strong parties? <em>Veto
Players</em> advances an important, new understanding of how
governments are structured. The real distinctions between political
systems, contends George Tsebelis, are to be found in the extent to
which they afford political actors veto power over policy choices.
Drawing richly on game theory, he develops a scheme by which
governments can thus be classified. He shows why an increase in the
number of "veto players," or an increase in their ideological
distance from each other, increases policy stability, impeding
significant departures from the status quo.</p><p>Policy stability affects a series of other key characteristics
of polities, argues the author. For example, it leads to high
judicial and bureaucratic independence, as well as high government
instability (in parliamentary systems). The propositions derived
from the theoretical framework Tsebelis develops in the first part
of the book are tested in the second part with various data sets
from advanced industrialized countries, as well as analysis of
legislation in the European Union. Representing the first
consistent and consequential theory of comparative politics,
<em>Veto Players</em> will be welcomed by students and scholars as
a defining text of the discipline.</p><p><em>From the preface to the Italian edition:</em></p><p>
"Tsebelis has produced what is today the most original theory
for the understanding of the dynamics of contemporary regimes. . .
. This book promises to remain a lasting contribution to political
analysis."--Gianfranco Pasquino, Professor of Political Science,
University of Bologna

abstract = {Abstract Arend Lijphart's Patterns of Democracy, similar to most of his work, elicited fierce scientific debate. This article replicates some of the analyses proposed in its second edition (published in 2012) in the light of the critiques received by the first edition (published in 2009). It primarily examines the relationship between institutional setup and interest group representation, disentangling the effect of consensualism from that of corporatism on issues such as macroeconomic performance and governance capabilities. The article further deepens our understanding of the complex causal mechanisms connecting these variables, proposing a more sophisticated empirical investigation that emphasises selection effects and conjunctural causation.}

abstract={Women are known to have stronger prosocial preferences than men, but it remains an open question as to how these behavioural differences arise from differences in brain functioning. Here, we provide a neurobiological account for the hypothesized gender difference. In a pharmacological study and an independent neuroimaging study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural reward system encodes the value of sharing money with others more strongly in women than in men. In the pharmacological study, we reduced receptor type-specific actions of dopamine, a neurotransmitter related to reward processing, which resulted in more selfish decisions in women and more prosocial decisions in men. Converging findings from an independent neuroimaging study revealed gender-related activity in neural reward circuits during prosocial decisions. Thus, the neural reward system appears to be more sensitive to prosocial rewards in women than in men, providing a neurobiological account for why women often behave more prosocially than men.},
